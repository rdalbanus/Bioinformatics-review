Short blurb on tools/concepts relevant to my research

## Software tools
**GREGOR** Can perform enrichments of SNPs in genomic features. We used it previously ([Varshney *et al* 2017](http://www.pnas.org/content/114/9/2301.long)) to determine that T2D variants were enriched in RFX footprints (predicted bound motifs). [Website](http://csg.sph.umich.edu/GREGOR/)

**GAT** Similar to GREGOR, but does enrichments of genomic features against genomic features. We used for our Thyomocyte development paper ([Tomonori and Albanus *et al* 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23774-9)). [Website](https://gat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

**CENTIPEDE** Our favorite tool for predicting TF binding from ATAC-seq data. [Website](http://centipede.uchicago.edu/)
